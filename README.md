## Personal finances automation

In this repo i will list down what i use to automate my finances. It can be existing tools or the script/library i build that can be useful to get transaction information.

## Background

Managing money can be a source of stress and taking a lot of time.
I have some some bills to pay, like utility, credit card, insurance, etc.
Because i want to track my expenses as well, i want to all "money out" from my pocket to be recorded in one single source.
Imagine how long it takes to record the transaction you have in the past month into 1 single source like Google Sheets? ü§î
So i think it worth to automate & list it down in here in case you also interested.

## Tools & Application
